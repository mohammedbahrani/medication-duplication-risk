Analysis of medication duplication patterns in fragmented healthcare systems using synthetic EHR data
# Medication Duplication Risk Analysis

## Overview
Analysis of medication duplication risk when healthcare facilities cannot 
exchange patient medication histories. Uses synthetic EHR data to identify 
care transition patterns where medication records are most likely incomplete.

## Motivation
As a hospital pharmacist, I observed how fragmented health information 
creates preventable safety risks during care transitions. This project 
quantifies that risk through data analysis.

## Methodology
- Synthetic EHR data analysis (patients, encounters, medications)
- Identification of patients visiting multiple healthcare facilities
- Pattern detection in care transitions
- Visualization of medication history gaps and duplication risk

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.x
- pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)
- matplotlib (visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Status
🚧 **In Development** - Analysis framework complete, preparing final visualizations
